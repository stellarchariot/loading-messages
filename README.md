loading-messages
================

Nobody likes to wait, but loading screens are a reality. Instead of a showing a plain old "Loading...please wait..." message, why not spice it up something more amusing instead? 

Inspired by Flickr's amusing loading messages, this repo contains funny loading messages you can use in your own projects.
